# 💔 CVD Prognosis Model: Random Forest Pipeline

This repository details an end-to-end machine learning project aimed at developing a prognosis model for the detection of **Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs)**—the world's leading cause of death.

The core deliverable is a **robust and optimized Random Forest classification pipeline** that uses cardiovascular health parameters to predict a patient's risk of CVD.

## 🚀 Project Highlights & Technical Skills

This project showcases expertise in developing reliable, production-ready machine learning solutions, a key requirement for a Senior Data Scientist role:

* **Problem-to-Model Translation:** Transforming a critical health challenge (CVD risk) into a quantifiable machine learning problem.
* **Pipeline Development:** Building a complete, reproducible ML pipeline encompassing data processing, hyperparameter tuning, training, and inference.
* **Model Optimization:** Focusing on **hyperparameter tuning** for the Random Forest model to maximize predictive performance and generalization (as highlighted in the project description).
* **Impactful Reporting:** Producing structured documentation (`C4 Final Report.pdf`) that clearly communicates methodology, results, and limitations to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

## 🔬 Methodology

The analysis follows a rigorous standard for data science projects:

1.  **Data Source:** Uses an open-source, cleaned dataset for cardiovascular health parameters.
    * *Dataset Link: [Cardio Data](https://www.kaggle.com/aiaiaidavid/cardio-data-dv13032020)*
2.  **Preprocessing:** Includes necessary steps for handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical features.
3.  **Model Selection:** Utilizes **Random Forest** for its strong predictive power, ability to handle non-linear data, and built-in feature importance insights.
4.  **Hyperparameter Optimization:** Employs techniques (e.g., Grid Search or Random Search) to find the optimal set of parameters for the Random Forest algorithm.
5.  **Evaluation:** Focuses on key classification metrics like **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score** to assess model fitness for a high-stakes prognosis application.
